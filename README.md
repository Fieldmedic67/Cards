game made by my friends and I in highschool

# Application Setup
run "npm install" in the terminal
enjoy

# Game Setup 
2-4 players with a given deck of cards (currently only supports 1v1 vs the computer)

The dealer (in this case the computer) will deal out 3 cards cards facedown to all players, followed by 3 cards faceup, and 3 cards into their hands, anyone can start the game, by simply playing any of their cards.

# General Rules
rotate Clockwise/Counter Clockwise --just be consistent (of course 1v1 it doesn't matter)

Play a card greater than or equal to the top card in the discard pile with ace being high card

Do not draw a card if you hand is greater than or equal to 3 at the end of your turn

The goal is to run out of cards, but you must draw back up to 3 at the end of your turn (as soon as you play a card) if the drawing pile is still in play

You may play multiple of the same card at the same time (suits do not matter)

If 4 of a kind is ever played or the 4th of a given card is placed into the discard pile then it will burn the pile moving it into the burn pile where it is no longer in play, the player who "burned" gets a second turn (draw as needed between rounds)

If a player cannot play on their turn they must pickup the discard/play pile 

When a player's hand is empty and the draw pile is gone, they may now play the faceup cards if multiple match (same number) they may play them at once and if they cannot make a valid move they may "attempt" to play picking up the card(s) they would like to have played that turn and adding it/them to their hand along with the discard pile

The hand must always be empty to play the cards that are on the table

Once all of their other cards are played they may "blindly" play the facedown cards. If unplayable add the card to your hand along with the discard pile

# Power-Cards

Power-Cards can be played on anything, greater than or equal doesn't apply here.

2: is a simple free round used if you cannot play anything else or you have better cards you'd like to hold onto. allows the next person to play whatever they want


3: "flash" this card at someone and they must pickup the discard pile; however, if they also have a "3" they may reverse the effect. All 3s that were played immediately go     into the burn pile and the player that it ended on will be skipped. "3"s can also be played "blind" if they are being used defensively at the end of the game (facedown cards)you will not look at the card but show it to the other player(s).

If it was a "3" then it works, otherwise you are at a disadvantage as they now know how to play against that card. (against the computer it doesn't currently matter it will work if it was a "3" and simply not work otherwise. logic may be applied later)


7: the following player must play a card less than a 7 (4/5/6) or of course another power card


10: burn the discard pile -- draw back up to 3 cards as required, play again

# tips & tricks

"7"s can win the game if played stategically; you can bait out low cards with a 2, and on the subsequent turn play a 7 in hopes they dont have any more low cards/Power

"10s" or "3"s can be played just before clearing your hand to play your table cards easily

Aside from a "3", a "7" or "Ace" are the best offensive cards especially towards the end of the game

Never play a "2" when the opponent is about to win; play your high cards unless you know they cant beat your "6".
